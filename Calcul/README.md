## Calculatrice

You look for a calculator. [Come on !](https://rawgit.com/C83/THP_Day37/master/Calcul/index.html)

Regular expression is used. Calculator works with the first number, and the last operator followed by the last number. If calculs line shows ```45 + 32 / 5```, the calcul will be ``` 45 / 5```.

If you clean the calculator, the result resets to 0. So, for the next step, you can't begin with a operator. 

You can make simple operation, clean datas, use followed operators. 

Enjoy !
